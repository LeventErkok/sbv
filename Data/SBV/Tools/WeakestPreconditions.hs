-- | A program over a state is simply a statement, together with
-- a pre-condition capturing environmental assumptions and
-- a post-condition that states its correctness. In the usual
-- Hoare-triple notation, it captures:
--
--   @ {precondition} program {postcondition} @
--
-- We also allow for a stability check, which is ensured at
-- every assignment statement to deal with ghost variables.
-- In general, this is useful for making sure what you consider
-- as "primary inputs" remain unaffected. Of course, you can
-- also put any arbitrary condition you want to check that you
-- want performed for each 'Assign' statement.
--
-- Note that stability is quite a strong condition: It is intended
-- to capture constants that never change during execution. So,
-- if you have a program that changes an input temporarily but
-- always restores it at the end, it would still fail the stability
-- condition.
--
-- The 'setup' field is reserved for any symbolic code you might
-- want to run before the proof takes place, typically for calls
-- to 'Data.SBV.setOption'. If not needed, simply pass @return ()@.
-- For an interesting use case where we use setup to axiomatize
-- the spec, see "Documentation.SBV.Examples.WeakestPreconditions.Fib"
-- and "Documentation.SBV.Examples.WeakestPreconditions.GCD".
