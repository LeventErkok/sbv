-- | Result of an inductive proof, with a counter-example in case of failure.
--
-- If a proof is found (indicated by a 'Proven' result), then the invariant holds
-- and the goal is established once the termination condition holds. If it fails, then
-- it can fail either in an initiation step or in a consecution step:
--
--    * A 'Failed' result in an 'Initiation' step means that the invariant does /not/ hold for
--      the initial state, and thus indicates a true failure.
--
--    * A 'Failed' result in a 'Consecution' step will return a state /s/. This state is known as a
--      CTI (counterexample to inductiveness): It will lead to a violation of the invariant
--      in one step. However, this does not mean the property is invalid: It could be the
--      case that it is simply not inductive. In this case, human intervention---or a smarter
--      algorithm like IC3 for certain domains---is needed to see if one can strengthen the
--      invariant so an inductive proof can be found. How this strengthening can be done remains
--      an art, but the science is improving with algorithms like IC3.
--
--    * A 'Failed' result in a 'PartialCorrectness' step means that the invariant holds, but assuming the
--      termination condition the goal still does not follow. That is, the partial correctness
--      does not hold.
