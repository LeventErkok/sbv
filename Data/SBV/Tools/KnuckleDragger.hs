-- | A class for doing equational reasoning style chained proofs. Use 'chainLemma' to prove a given theorem
-- as a sequence of equalities, each step following from the previous.
class ChainLemma steps step | steps -> step where

  -- | Prove a property via a series of equality steps, using the default solver.
  -- Let @H@ be a list of already established lemmas. Let @P@ be a property we wanted to prove, named @name@.
  -- Consider a call of the form @chainLemma name P [A, B, C, D] H@. Note that @H@ is
  -- a list of already proven facts, ensured by the type signature. We proceed as follows:
  --
  --    * Prove: @H -> A == B@
  --    * Prove: @H && A == B -> B == C@
  --    * Prove: @H && A == B && B == C -> C == D@
  --    * Prove: @H && A == B && B == C && C == D -> P@
  --    * If all of the above steps succeed, conclude @P@.
  --
  -- Note that if the type of steps (i.e., @A@ .. @D@ above) is 'SBool', then we use implication
  -- as opposed to equality; which better captures line of reasoning.
  --
  -- So, chain-lemma is essentially modus-ponens, applied in a sequence of stepwise equality reasoning in the case of
  -- non-boolean steps.
  --
  -- If there are no helpers given (i.e., if @H@ is empty), then this call is equivalent to 'lemmaWith'.
  -- If @H@ is a singleton, then we error-out. A single step in @H@ indicates a user-error, since there's
  -- no sequence of steps to reason about.
