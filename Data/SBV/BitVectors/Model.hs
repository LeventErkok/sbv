-- | Symbolic Numbers. This is a simple class that simply incorporates all number like
-- base types together, simplifying writing polymorphic type-signatures that work for all
-- symbolic numbers, such as 'SWord8', 'SInt8' etc. For instance, we can write a generic
-- list-minimum function as follows:
--
-- @
--    mm :: SIntegral a => [SBV a] -> SBV a
--    mm = foldr1 (\a b -> ite (a .<= b) a b)
-- @

-- It is similar to the standard 'Integral' class, except ranging over symbolic instances.

                    () -> do {- It is tempting to record the choice of the test expression here as we branch down to the 'then' and 'else' branches. That is,
                                when we evaluate 'a', we can make use of the fact that the test expression is True, and similarly we can use the fact that it
                                is False when b is evaluated. In certain cases this can cut down on symbolic simulation significantly, for instance if
                                repetitive decisions are made in a recursive loop. Unfortunately, the implementation of this idea is quite tricky, due to
                                our sharing based implementation. As the 'then' branch is evaluated, we will create many expressions that are likely going
                                to be "reused" when the 'else' branch is executed. But, it would be *dead wrong* to share those values, as they were "cached"
                                under the incorrect assumptions. To wit, consider the following:

                                   foo x y = ite (y .== 0) k (k+1)
                                     where k = ite (y .== 0) x (x+1)

                                When we reduce the 'then' branch of the first ite, we'd record the assumption that y is 0. But while reducing the 'then' branch, we'd
                                like to share 'k', which would evaluate (correctly) to 'x' under the given assumption. When we backtrack and evaluate the 'else'
                                branch of the first ite, we'd see 'k' is needed again, and we'd look it up from our sharing map to find (incorrectly) that its value
                                is 'x', which was stored there under the assumption that y was 0, which no longer holds. Clearly, this is unsound.

                                A sound implementation would have to precisely track which assumptions were active at the time expressions get shared. That is,
                                in the above example, we should record that the value of 'k' was cached under the assumption that 'y' is 0. While sound, this
                                approach unfortunately leads to significant loss of valid sharing when the value itself had nothing to do with the assumption itself.
                                To wit, consider:

                                   foo x y = ite (y .== 0) k (k+1)
                                     where k = x+5

                                If we tracked the assumptions, we would recompute 'k' twice, since the branch assumptions would differ. Clearly, there is no need to
                                re-compute 'k' in this case since its value is independent of y. Note that the whole SBV performance story is based on agressive sharing,
                                and losing that would have other significant ramifications.

                                The "proper" solution would be to track, with each shared computation, precisely which assumptions it actually *depends* on, rather
                                than blindly recording all the assumptions present at that time. SBV's symbolic simulation engine clearly has all the info needed to do this
                                properly, but the implementation is not straightforward at all. For each subexpression, we would need to chase down its dependencies
                                transitively, which can require a lot of scanning of the generated program causing major slow-down; thus potentially defeating the
                                whole purpose of sharing in the first place.

                                Design choice: Keep it simple, and simply do not track the assumption at all. This will maximize sharing, at the cost of evaluating
                                unreachable branches. I think the simplicity is more important at this point than efficiency.

                                Also note that the user can avoid most such issues by properly combining if-then-else's with common conditions together. That is, the
                                first program above should be written like this:

                                  foo x y = ite (y .== 0) x (x+2)

                                In general, the following transformations should be done whenever possible:

                                  ite e1 (ite e1 e2 e3) e4  --> ite e1 e2 e4
                                  ite e1 e2 (ite e1 e3 e4)  --> ite e1 e2 e4

                                This is in accordance with the general rule-of-thumb stating conditionals should be avoided as much as possible. However, we might prefer
                                the following:

                                  ite e1 (f e2 e4) (f e3 e5) --> f (ite e1 e2 e3) (ite e1 e4 e5)

                               especially if this expression happens to be inside 'f's body itself (i.e., when f is recursive), since it reduces the number of
                               recursive calls. Clearly, programming with symbolic simulation in mind is another kind of beast alltogether.

-- | Adding arbitrary constraints. When adding constraints, one has to be careful about
-- making sure they are not inconsistent. The function 'isVacuous' can be use for this purpose.
-- Here is an example. Consider the following predicate:
--
-- >>> let pred = do { x <- forall "x"; constrain $ x .< x; return $ x .>= (5 :: SWord8) }
--
-- This predicate asserts that all 8-bit values are larger than 5, subject to the constraint that the
-- values considered satisfy @x .< x@, i.e., they are less than themselves. Since there are no values that
-- satisfy this constraint, the proof will pass vacuously:
--
-- >>> prove pred
-- Q.E.D.
--
-- We can use 'isVacuous' to make sure to see that the pass was vacuous:
--
-- >>> isVacuous pred
-- True
--
-- While the above example is trivial, things can get complicated if there are multiple constraints with
-- non-straightforward relations; so if constraints are used one should make sure to check the predicate
-- is not vacuously true. Here's an example that is not vacuous:
--
--  >>> let pred' = do { x <- forall "x"; constrain $ x .> 6; return $ x .>= (5 :: SWord8) }
--
-- This time the proof passes as expected:
--
--  >>> prove pred'
--  Q.E.D.
--
-- And the proof is not vacuous:
--
--  >>> isVacuous pred'
--  False
