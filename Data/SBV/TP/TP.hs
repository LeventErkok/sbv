-- | A class for doing equational reasoning style calculational proofs. Use 'calc' to prove a given theorem

class Calc a where
  -- | Prove a property via a series of equality steps, using the default solver.
  -- Let @H@ be a list of already established lemmas. Let @P@ be a property we wanted to prove, named @name@.
  -- Consider a call of the form @calc name P (cond, [A, B, C, D]) H@. Note that @H@ is
  -- a list of already proven facts, ensured by the type signature. We proceed as follows:
  --
  --    * Prove: @(H && cond)                                   -> (A == B)@
  --    * Prove: @(H && cond && A == B)                         -> (B == C)@
  --    * Prove: @(H && cond && A == B && B == C)               -> (C == D)@
  --    * Prove: @(H && (cond -> (A == B && B == C && C == D))) -> P@
  --    * If all of the above steps succeed, conclude @P@.
  --
  -- cond acts as the context. Typically, if you are trying to prove @Y -> Z@, then you want cond to be Y.
  -- (This is similar to @intros@ commands in theorem provers.)
  --
  -- So, calc-lemma is essentially modus-ponens, applied in a sequence of stepwise equality reasoning in the case of
  -- non-boolean steps.
  --
  -- If there are no helpers given (i.e., if @H@ is empty), then this call is equivalent to 'lemmaWith'.
