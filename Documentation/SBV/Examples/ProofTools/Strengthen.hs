-- An example showing how traditional state-transition invariance problems
-- can be coded using SBV, using induction. We also demonstrate the use of
-- invariant strengthening.
--
-- This example comes from Bradley's [Understanding IC3](http://theory.stanford.edu/~arbrad/papers/Understanding_IC3.pdf) paper,
-- which considers the following two programs:
--
-- @
--      x, y := 1, 1                    x, y := 1, 1
--      while *:                        while *:
--        x, y := x+1, y+x                x, y := x+y, y+x
-- @
--
-- Where @*@ stands for non-deterministic choice. For each program we try to prove that @y >= 1@ is an invariant.
--
-- It turns out that the property @y >= 1@ is indeed an invariant, but is
-- not inductive for either program. We proceed to strengten the invariant
-- and establish it for the first case. We then note that the same strengthening
-- doesn't work for the second program, and find a further strengthening to
-- establish that case as well. This example follows the introductory example
-- in Bradley's paper quite closely.

-- * Examples

-- | Example 1: First program, with no strengthenings. We have:
--
-- >>> ex1
-- Failed while establishing consecution.
-- Counter-example to inductiveness:
--   (S {x = -1, y = 1},S {x = 0, y = 0})
ex1 :: IO (InductionResult (S Integer))
ex1 = problem pgm1 strengthenings
  where strengthenings :: [(String, S SInteger -> SBool)]
        strengthenings = []

-- | Example 2: First program, strengthened with @x >= 0@. We have:
--
-- >>> ex2
-- Q.E.D.
ex2 :: IO (InductionResult (S Integer))
ex2 = problem pgm1 strengthenings
  where strengthenings :: [(String, S SInteger -> SBool)]
        strengthenings = [("x >= 0", \S{x} -> x .>= 0)]

-- | Example 3: Second program, with no strengthenings. We have:
--
-- >>> ex3
-- Failed while establishing consecution.
-- Counter-example to inductiveness:
--   (S {x = -1, y = 1},S {x = 0, y = 0})
ex3 :: IO (InductionResult (S Integer))
ex3 = problem pgm2 strengthenings
  where strengthenings :: [(String, S SInteger -> SBool)]
        strengthenings = []

-- | Example 4: Second program, strengthened with @x >= 0@. We have:
--
-- >>> ex4
-- Failed while establishing consecution for strengthening "x >= 0".
-- Counter-example to inductiveness:
--   (S {x = 0, y = -1},S {x = -1, y = -1})
ex4 :: IO (InductionResult (S Integer))
ex4 = problem pgm2 strengthenings
  where strengthenings :: [(String, S SInteger -> SBool)]
        strengthenings = [("x >= 0", \S{x} -> x .>= 0)]

-- | Example 5: Second program, strengthened with @x >= 0@ and @y >= 1@ separately. We have:
--
-- >>> ex5
-- Failed while establishing consecution for strengthening "x >= 0".
-- Counter-example to inductiveness:
--   (S {x = 0, y = -1},S {x = -1, y = -1})
--
-- Note how this was sufficient in 'ex2' to establish the invariant for the first
-- program, but fails for the second.
ex5 :: IO (InductionResult (S Integer))
ex5 = problem pgm2 strengthenings

                         ]

-- | Example 6: Second program, strengthened with @x >= 0 \/\\ y >= 1@ simultaneously. We have:
--
-- >>> ex6
-- Q.E.D.
--
-- Compare this to 'ex5'. As pointed out by Bradley, this shows that
-- /a conjunction of assertions can be inductive when none of its components, on its own, is inductive./
-- It remains an art to find proper loop invariants, though the science is improving!
