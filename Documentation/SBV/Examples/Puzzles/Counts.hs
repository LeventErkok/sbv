--
-- Consider the sentence:
--
-- @
--    In this sentence, the number of occurrences of 0 is _, of 1 is _, of 2 is _,
--    of 3 is _, of 4 is _, of 5 is _, of 6 is _, of 7 is _, of 8 is _, and of 9 is _.
-- @
--
-- The puzzle is to fill the blanks with numbers, such that the sentence
-- will be correct. There are precisely two solutions to this puzzle, both of
-- which are found by SBV successfully.
