-- This is a formalization of the Cheryl's birthday problem, which went viral in April 2015.
--
-- Here's the puzzle:
--
-- @
-- Albert and Bernard just met Cheryl. "When’s your birthday?" Albert asked Cheryl.
--
-- Cheryl thought a second and said, "I’m not going to tell you, but I’ll give you some clues." She wrote down a list of 10 dates:
--
--   May 15, May 16, May 19
--   June 17, June 18
--   July 14, July 16
--   August 14, August 15, August 17
--
-- "My birthday is one of these," she said.
--
-- Then Cheryl whispered in Albert’s ear the month — and only the month — of her birthday. To Bernard, she whispered the day, and only the day.
-- “Can you figure it out now?” she asked Albert.
--
-- Albert: I don’t know when your birthday is, but I know Bernard doesn’t know, either.
-- Bernard: I didn’t know originally, but now I do.
-- Albert: Well, now I know, too!
--
-- When is Cheryl’s birthday?
-- @
--
-- NB. Thanks to Amit Goel for suggesting the formalization strategy used in here.

-- * The puzzle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Encode the conversation as given in the puzzle.
--
-- NB. Lee Pike pointed out that not all the constraints are actually necessary! (Private
-- communication.) The puzzle still has a unique solution if the statements @a1@ and @b1@
-- (i.e., Albert and Bernard saying they themselves do not know the answer) are removed.
-- To experiment you can simply comment out those statements and observe that there still
-- is a unique solution. Thanks to Lee for pointing this out! In fact, it is instructive to
-- assert the conversation line-by-line, and see how the search-space gets reduced in each
-- step.
