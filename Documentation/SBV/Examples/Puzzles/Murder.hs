-- Solution to "Malice and Alice," from George J. Summers' Logical Deduction Puzzles:
--
-- @
-- A man and a woman were together in a bar at the time of the murder.
-- The victim and the killer were together on a beach at the time of the murder.
-- One of Alice’s two children was alone at the time of the murder.
-- Alice and her husband were not together at the time of the murder.
-- The victim's twin was not the killer.
-- The killer was younger than the victim.

-- Who killed who?
