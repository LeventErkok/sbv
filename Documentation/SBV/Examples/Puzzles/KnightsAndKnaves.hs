-- From Raymond Smullyan: On a fictional island, all inhabitants are either knights,
-- who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie. John and Bill are residents
-- of the island of knights and knaves. John and Bill make several utterances.
-- Determine which one is a knave or a knight, depending on their answers.

-- Question 2.
--   John says If (and only if) Bill is a knave, then I am a knave.
--   Bill says We are of different kinds.
--     Then, John is: Knave
--     And,  Bill is: Knight
