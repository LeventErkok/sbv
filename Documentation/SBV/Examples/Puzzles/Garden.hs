-- The origin of this puzzle is Raymond Smullyan's "The Flower Garden" riddle:
--
--     In a certain flower garden, each flower was either red, yellow,
--     or blue, and all three colors were represented. A statistician
--     once visited the garden and made the observation that whatever
--     three flowers you picked, at least one of them was bound to be red.
--     A second statistician visited the garden and made the observation
--     that whatever three flowers you picked, at least one was bound to
--     be yellow.
--
--     Two logic students heard about this and got into an argument.
--     The first student said: “It therefore follows that whatever
--     three flowers you pick, at least one is bound to be blue, doesn’t
--     it?” The second student said: “Of course not!”
--
--     Which student was right, and why?
--
-- We slightly modify the puzzle. Assuming the first student is right, we use
-- SBV to show that the garden must contain exactly 3 flowers. In any other
-- case, the second student would be right.

-- | Solve the puzzle. We have:

-- Solution #1:
--   N = 3 :: Integer
-- This is the only solution.
--
-- So, a garden with 3 flowers is the only solution. (Note that we simply skip
-- over the prefix existentials and the assignments to uninterpreted function 'col'
-- for model purposes here, as they don't represent a different solution.)
