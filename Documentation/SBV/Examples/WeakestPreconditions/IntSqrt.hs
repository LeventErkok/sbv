-- Proof of correctness of an imperative integer square-root algorithm, using
-- weakest preconditions. The algorithm computes the floor of the square-root
-- of a given non-negative integer by keeping a running some of all odd numbers
-- starting from 1. Recall that @1+3+5+...+(2n+1) = (n+1)^2@, thus we can
-- stop the counting when we exceed the input number.

-- * Correctness

-- | The invariant is that at each iteration of the loop @sqrt@ remains below or equal
-- to the actual square-root, and @i@ tracks the square of the next value. We also
-- have that @j@ is the @sqrt@'th odd value. Coming up with this invariant is not for
-- the faint of heart, for details I would strongly recommend looking at Manna's seminal
-- /Mathematical Theory of Computation/ book (chapter 3). The @j .> 0@ part is needed
-- to establish the termination.

invariant SqrtS{x, sqrt, i, j} = j .> 0 .&& sq sqrt .<= x .&& i .== sq (sqrt + 1) .&& j .== 2*sqrt + 1

-- | The measure. In each iteration @i@ strictly increases, thus reducing the differential @x - i@
measure :: Measure S
measure SqrtS{x, i} = [x - i]

-- | Check that the program terminates and the post condition holds. We have:
