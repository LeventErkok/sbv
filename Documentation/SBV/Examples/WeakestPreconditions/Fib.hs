-- Proof of correctness of an imperative fibonacci algorithm, using weakest
-- preconditions. Note that due to the recursive nature of fibonacci, we
-- cannot write the spec directly, so we use an uninterpreted function
-- and proper axioms to complete the proof.

-- * Program state

-- | The state for the sum program, parameterized over a base type @a@.

-- @
--
-- When the loop terminates, @m@ contains @fib(n)@.

-- | Symbolic fibonacci as our specification. Note that we cannot
-- really implement the fibonacci function since it is not
-- symbolically terminating.  So, we instead uninterpret and
-- axiomatize it below.
--
-- NB. The concrete part of the definition is only used in calls to 'traceExecution'
-- and is not needed for the proof. If you don't need to call 'traceExecution', you
-- can simply ignore that part and directly uninterpret.

-- * Correctness

-- | With the axioms in place, it is trivial to establish correctness:
--
-- >>> correctness
-- Total correctness is established.
-- Q.E.D.
--
-- Note that I found this proof to be quite fragile: If you do not get the algorithm right
-- or the axioms aren't in place, z3 simply goes to an infinite loop, instead of providing
-- counter-examples. Of course, this is to be expected with the quantifiers present.

-- * Concrete execution
-- $concreteExec

{- $concreteExec

Example concrete run. As we mentioned in the definition for 'fib', the concrete-execution
function cannot deal with uninterpreted functions and axioms for obvious reasons. In those
cases we revert to the concrete definition. Here's an example run:

>>> traceExecution imperativeFib $ FibS {n = 3, i = 0, k = 0, m = 0}
*** Precondition holds, starting execution:
  {n = 3, i = 0, k = 0, m = 0}
===> [1.1] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 0, k = 1, m = 0}
===> [1.2] Conditional, taking the "then" branch
  {n = 3, i = 0, k = 1, m = 0}
===> [1.2.1] Skip
  {n = 3, i = 0, k = 1, m = 0}
===> [1.3] Loop "i < n": condition holds, executing the body
  {n = 3, i = 0, k = 1, m = 0}
===> [1.3.{1}.1] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 0, k = 1, m = 1}
===> [1.3.{1}.2] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 1, k = 1, m = 1}
===> [1.3] Loop "i < n": condition holds, executing the body
  {n = 3, i = 1, k = 1, m = 1}
===> [1.3.{2}.1] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 1, k = 2, m = 1}
===> [1.3.{2}.2] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 2, k = 2, m = 1}
===> [1.3] Loop "i < n": condition holds, executing the body
  {n = 3, i = 2, k = 2, m = 1}
===> [1.3.{3}.1] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 2, k = 3, m = 2}
===> [1.3.{3}.2] Assign
  {n = 3, i = 3, k = 3, m = 2}
===> [1.3] Loop "i < n": condition fails, terminating
  {n = 3, i = 3, k = 3, m = 2}
*** Program successfully terminated, post condition holds of the final state:
  {n = 3, i = 3, k = 3, m = 2}
Program terminated successfully. Final state:
  {n = 3, i = 3, k = 3, m = 2}

As expected, @fib 3@ is @2@.
