-- Proof of correctness of an imperative integer division algorithm, using
-- weakest preconditions. The algorithm simply keeps subtracting the divisor

-- | The state for the division program, parameterized over a base type @a@.

-- * The algorithm

-- | The imperative division algorithm, assuming non-negative @x@ and strictly positive @y@:
--
-- @
--    r = x                     -- set remainder to x
--    q = 0                     -- set quotient  to 0
--    while y <= r              -- while we can still subtract
--      r = r - y                    -- reduce the remainder
--      q = q + 1                    -- increase the quotient
-- @
--
-- Note that we need to explicitly annotate each loop with its invariant and the termination
-- measure. For convenience, we take those two as parameters for simplicity.

-- | Precondition for our program: @x@ must non-negative and @y@ must be strictly positive.
-- Note that there is an explicit call to 'Data.SBV.Tools.WeakestPreconditions.abort' in our program to protect against this case, so
-- if we do not have this precondition, all programs will fail.
pre :: D -> SBool
pre DivS{x, y} = x .>= 0 .&& y .> 0

-- | Postcondition for our program: Remainder must be non-negative and less than @y@,
-- and it must hold that @x = q*y + r@:
post :: D -> SBool
post DivS{x, y, q, r} = r .>= 0 .&& r .< y .&& x .== q * y + r

-- | Stability: @x@ and @y@ must remain unchanged.

-- * Correctness

-- | The invariant is simply that @x = q * y + r@ holds at all times and @r@ is strictly positive.
-- We need the @y > 0@ part of the invariant to establish the measure decreases, which is guaranteed
-- by our precondition.
invariant :: Invariant D
invariant DivS{x, y, q, r} = y .> 0 .&& r .>= 0 .&& x .== q * y + r

-- | The measure. In each iteration @r@ decreases, but always remains positive.
-- Since @y@ is strictly positive, @r@ can serve as a measure for the loop.
measure :: Measure D
measure DivS{r} = [r]

-- | Check that the program terminates and the post condition holds. We have:
--
-- >>> correctness
-- Total correctness is established.
