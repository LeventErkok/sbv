-- Proof of correctness of an imperative GCD (greatest-common divisor)
-- algorithm, using weakest preconditions. The termination measure here
-- illustrates the use of lexicographic ordering. Also, since symbolic
-- version of GCD is not symbolically terminating, this is another
-- example of using uninterpreted functions and axioms as one writes
-- specifications for WP proofs.

-- * The algorithm

-- | The imperative GCD algorithm, assuming strictly positive @x@ and @y@:
--
-- @
--    i = x
--    j = y
--    while i != j      -- While not equal
--      if i > j
--         i = i - j    -- i is greater; reduce it by j
--      else
--         j = j - i    -- j is greater; reduce it by i
-- @
--
-- When the loop terminates, @i@ equals @j@ and contains @GCD(x, y)@.
algorithm :: Stmt G
algorithm = Seq [ assert "x > 0, y > 0" $ \GCDS{x, y} -> x .> 0 .&& y .> 0
                , Assign $ \st@GCDS{x, y} -> st{i = x, j = y}
                , While "i != j"

                        (\GCDS{i, j} -> i ./= j)
                        $ If (\GCDS{i, j} -> i .> j)
                             (Assign $ \st@GCDS{i, j} -> st{i = i - j})

  where -- This invariant simply states that the value of the gcd remains the same
        -- through the iterations.
        inv GCDS{x, y, i, j} = x .> 0 .&& y .> 0 .&& i .> 0 .&& j .> 0 .&& gcd x y .== gcd i j

        -- The measure can be taken as @i+j@ going down. However, we
        -- can be more explicit and use the lexicographic nature: Notice
        -- that in each iteration either @i@ goes down, or it stays the same
        -- and @j@ goes down; and they never go below @0@. So we can
        -- have the pair and use the lexicographic ordering.
        msr GCDS{i, j} = [i, j]

-- | Symbolic GCD as our specification. Note that we cannot
-- really implement the GCD function since it is not
-- symbolically terminating.  So, we instead uninterpret and
-- axiomatize it below.
--
-- NB. The concrete part of the definition is only used in calls to 'traceExecution'
-- and is not needed for the proof. If you don't need to call 'traceExecution', you
-- can simply ignore that part and directly uninterpret. In that case, we simply
-- use Prelude's version.

-- * Correctness

-- | With the axioms in place, it is trivial to establish correctness:
--
-- >>> correctness
-- Total correctness is established.
-- Q.E.D.
--
-- Note that I found this proof to be quite fragile: If you do not get the algorithm right
-- or the axioms aren't in place, z3 simply goes to an infinite loop, instead of providing
-- counter-examples. Of course, this is to be expected with the quantifiers present.

-- * Concrete execution
-- $concreteExec

{- $concreteExec

Example concrete run. As we mentioned in the definition for 'gcd', the concrete-execution
function cannot deal with uninterpreted functions and axioms for obvious reasons. In those
cases we revert to the concrete definition. Here's an example run:

>>> traceExecution imperativeGCD $ GCDS {x = 14, y = 4, i = 0, j = 0}

===> [1.3] Loop "i != j": condition fails, terminating
  {x = 14, y = 4, i = 2, j = 2}
*** Program successfully terminated, post condition holds of the final state:
  {x = 14, y = 4, i = 2, j = 2}
Program terminated successfully. Final state:
  {x = 14, y = 4, i = 2, j = 2}

As expected, @gcd 14 4@ is @2@.
