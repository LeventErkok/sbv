--
-- A company makes two products (X and Y) using two machines (A and B).
--
--   - Each unit of X that is produced requires 50 minutes processing time on machine
--     A and 30 minutes processing time on machine B.
--
--   - Each unit of Y that is produced requires 24 minutes processing time on machine
--     A and 33 minutes processing time on machine B.
--
--   - At the start of the current week there are 30 units of X and 90 units of Y in stock.
--     Available processing time on machine A is forecast to be 40 hours and on machine B is
--     forecast to be 35 hours.
--
--   - The demand for X in the current week is forecast to be 75 units and for Y is forecast
--     to be 95 units.
--
--   - Company policy is to maximise the combined sum of the units of X and the units of Y
--     in stock at the end of the week.
--
-- How much of each product should we make in the current week?
--
-- We have:

-- >>> optimize lexicographic production
-- Optimal model:
--   X     = 45 :: Integer
--   Y     =  6 :: Integer
--   stock =  1 :: Integer
--
-- That is, we should produce 45 X's and 6 Y's, with the final maximum stock of just 1 expected!
