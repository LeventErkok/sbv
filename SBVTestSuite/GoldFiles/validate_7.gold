[VALIDATE] Validating the model. Assignment:
[VALIDATE]       x = -Infinity :: Float
[VALIDATE] There are no constraints to check.
[VALIDATE] Validating outputs.

FINAL OUTPUT:
*** Data.SBV: Cannot validate the model, since s1 is not concretely computable.
*** 
*** Assignment:
*** 
***       x = -Infinity :: Float
*** 
*** The value depends on a quantified variable.
*** 
*** SBV's model validator is incomplete, and cannot handle this particular case.
*** Please report this as a feature request or possibly a bug!
***
*** Alleged model:
***
*** Satisfiable. Model:
***   x = -Infinity :: Float
