[VALIDATE] Validating the model. Assignment:
[VALIDATE]       x =                -Infinity :: Float
[VALIDATE]       y = <universally quantified> :: Float
[VALIDATE] NB. The following variable(s) are universally quantified: y
[VALIDATE]     We will assume that they are essentially zero for the purposes of validation.
[VALIDATE]     Note that this is a gross simplification of the model validation with universals!
[VALIDATE] There are no constraints to check.
[VALIDATE] Validating outputs.
[VALIDATE] All outputs are satisfied. Validation complete.

FINAL OUTPUT:
Satisfiable. Model:
  x = -Infinity :: Float
