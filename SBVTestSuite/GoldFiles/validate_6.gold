[VALIDATE] Validating the model. Assignment:
[VALIDATE]       x = 13 :: Integer
[VALIDATE]       y = 11 :: Integer
[VALIDATE] Validating 2 constraint(s).
[VALIDATE] Validated all constraints.
[VALIDATE] Validating outputs.
[VALIDATE] Counterexample is validated.

FINAL OUTPUT:
Falsifiable. Counter-example:
  x = 13 :: Integer
  y = 11 :: Integer
