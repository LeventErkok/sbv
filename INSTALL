The sbv library can be installed simply by issuing cabal install
like this:

     cabal install sbv

SBV relies on an external SMT solver to be installed. We currently support
ABC, Boolector, Bitwuzla, CVC4, CVC5, DReal, MathSAT, OpenSMT, Yices, and Z3. We recommend installing the
freely available z3 SMT solver from Microsoft, the default solver used
by SBV. You can get it from <http://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>.

Please make sure that the "z3" executable is in your path.
